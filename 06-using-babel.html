<p>
<em><a target="_blank" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/" target="_blank">ES6 In Depth</a> is a series on new features being added to the JavaScript programming language in the 6th Edition of the ECMAScript standard, ES6 for short.</em>
</p>

<p>
ES6 is here, people is starting to talk about ES7 and the future holds for us more features and shiny things through newer standards. We all wonder, how can we make use of all that? In previous entries of this series we have always repeated:
<p>

<blockquote>
If you’d like to use this new syntax on the web, you can use <a target="_blank" title="Babel JS Compiler" href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> or <a target="_blank" title="Traceur JS Compiler" href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler">Google's Traceur</a> to translate your ES6 code to Web-friendly ES5.
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, finally its the time for us to show you step by step how to do it. The mentioned tools are called transpilers, that is a source to source compiler, so they are known as compilers too. What they allow us to do is write code using ES6 while also guaranteeing that we'll be able to execute it in every browser.
</p>

<h2>Transpilation our salvation</h2>

<p>
A transpiler is very easy to use, you can describe what it does in only two steps:
</p>

1. We write code with ES6 syntax.

<p><code class="js"><pre>
let q = 99;
let myVariable = `${q} bottles of beer on the wall, ${q} bottles of beer.`;
</pre></code></p>

2. We use the code above as input for the transpiler which will process it and produce the following output:

<p><code class="js"><pre>
"use strict";

var q = 99;
var myVariable = "" + q + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + q + " bottles of beer."
</pre></code></p>

<p>
The good old JavaScript that we all know and that can be used in any browser.
</p>

<p>
The internals of what a transpiler does to go from input to output are highly complex things that fall out of scope for this guide. Just as we can drive a car without knowing all the internal mechanics, we'll leave the transpiler as a blackbox that is able to process our code.
</p>

<h3>Babel in action</h3>

<p>
There are a couple of different ways for you to use Babel in a project. There is a command line tool for which you'll use commands of the form:
</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
babel script.js --out-file script-compiled.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Also, a browser ready version is provided. You can include it as a regular JS library and then you can place your ES6 code in script tags with the type <code>"text/babel"</code>.
</p>

<p><code class="html"><pre>
&lt;script src="node_modules/babel-core/browser.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/babel">
// Your ES6 code
&lt;/script>
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Those methods do not scale when your code base starts to grow and you start splitting everything in multiple files and folders. At that moment you'll need a build tool and a way to integrate Babel to a build pipeline.
<p>

<p>
In the following sections we'll integrate Babel into a build tool, <a target="_blank" title="Broccoli JS" href="http://broccolijs.com/">Broccoli.js</a>, and we'll write and execute our first lines of ES6 through a couple of examples. In case you run into trouble, you can review the complete source code here: <a target="_blank" title="broccoli-babel-examples" href="https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples">broccoli-babel-examples</a>. There you'll find three sample projects:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>es6-fruits</li>
  <li>es6-website</li>
  <li>es6-modules</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each one of them builds on top of the previous example. We start with the bare minimum and progress to a general solution meant to be used as the starting point of a real project.
</p>

<p>
If you are thinking &mdash;I'll just wait for browsers to support the new features&mdash; you'll be left behind. That is going to take a long time, if it ever happens to full compliance. Transpilers are here to stay; new ECMAScript standards are planned to be released yearly. So, we'll see new stantards released faster than uniform browser platforms, each year. Hop in already and take advantage of the new features.
</p>

<h2>Our first Broccoli &amp; Babel project</h2>

<p>
Broccoli is a tool designed to build projects and to do it as fast as possible. You can uglify and minify files, among many other things through the use of <a target="_blank" title="npm broccoli-plugin" href="https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/broccoli-plugin">Broccoli plugins</a>. It saves us the burden of handling files, directories and executing commands each time we introduce changes to a project.
</p>

<blockquote>
Comparable to the Rails asset pipeline in scope, though it runs on Node and is backend-agnostic.
</blockquote>

<h3>Project setup</h3>

<h4>Node</h4>

<p>
As you might have guessed, you'll have to install <a target="_blank" title="Node JS" href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>, version 0.11 at least. There are many ways to do this, a highly recommended option is to use <a target="_blank" title="nvm" href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager (NVM)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Depending on how you installed Node, is possible that you'll need to execute the <code>npm -g</code> commands prepending <code>sudo</code> to them.
</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
sudo npm -g install some-package-name
</pre></code></p>

<p>
If you are using NVM you won't need to do that.
</p>

<h4>Broccoli</h4>

<p>We'll setup our Broccoli project first with:</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
mkdir es6-fruits
cd es6-fruits
npm init
# Create an empty file called Brocfile.js
touch Brocfile.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>Now we install <code>broccoli</code> and <code>broccoli-cli</code></p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
# the broccoli library
npm install --save-dev broccoli
# command line tool
npm install -g broccoli-cli
</pre></code></p>

<h3>Write some ES6</h3>

<p>We'll create a <code>src</code> folder and inside we'll put a <code>fruits.js</code> file.</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
mkdir src
vim src/fruits.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>
In our new file we'll write a small script using ES6 syntax.
</p>

<p><code class="js"><pre>
let fruits = [
  {id: 100, name: 'strawberry'},
  {id: 101, name: 'grapefruit'},
  {id: 102, name: 'plum'}
];

for (let fruit of fruits) {
  let message = `ID: ${fruit.id} Name: ${fruit.name}`;

  console.log(message);
}

console.log(`List total: ${fruits.length}`);
</pre></code></p>

<p>The code sample above makes use of three ES6 features:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>let</code> for local scope declarations (we'll discuss this in a future blog post)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" title="es6 in depth: iterators and the for of loop" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-iterators-and-the-for-of-loop/">for-of loops</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" title="es6 in depth: template strings" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-template-strings-2/">template strings</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Save the file and try to execute it.</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
node src/fruits.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>It won't work yet, but we are about to make it executable by Node and any browser.</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
let fruits = [
    ^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
</pre></code></p>

<h3>Transpilation time</h3>

<p>
Now we'll use Broccoli to load our code and push it through Babel. We'll edit the file <code>Brocfile.js</code> and add this code to it:
</p>

<p><code class="js"><pre>
// import the babel plugin
var babel = require('broccoli-babel-transpiler');

// grab the source and transpile it in 1 step
fruits = babel('src'); // src/*.js

module.exports = fruits;
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Notice that we are requiring <code>broccoli-babel-transpiler</code>, that is a Broccoli plugin that wraps around the Babel library, so we must install it with:
</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
npm install --save-dev broccoli-babel-transpiler
</pre></code></p>

<p>Now we can build our project and execute our script with:</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
# this time we execute
# from dist/ instead of src/
broccoli build dist
node dist/fruits.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
ID: 100 Name: strawberry
ID: 101 Name: grapefruit
ID: 102 Name: plum
List total: 3
</pre></code></p>

<p>That was easy! You can open <code>dist/fruits.js</code> to see what the transpiled code looks like. A nice feature of the Babel transpiler is that it produces readable code.
</p>

<h2>Writing ES6 code for a website</h2>

<p>
For our second example we'll take it up a notch. In the <code>src</code> folder we'll create three files:
</p>

<code>src/index.html</code>
<p><code class="html"><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;title>ES6 Today&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;style>
      .color {
        padding: 1rem;
        color: #fff;
      }
    &lt;/style>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;h1>ES6 Today&lt;/h1>

        &lt;div id="info">&lt;/div>

        &lt;hr>

        &lt;div id="content">&lt;/div>

        &lt;script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js">&lt;/script>
        &lt;script src="js/my-app.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre></code></p>

<code>src/print-info.js</code>
<p><code class="js"><pre>
function printInfo() {
  $('#info')
  .append('&lt;p&gt;minimal website example with Broccoli and Babel&lt;/p&gt;');
}

$(printInfo);
</pre></code></p>

<code>src/print-colors.js</code>
<p><code class="js"><pre>
function* hexRange(start, stop, step) { // ES6 Generator
  for (var i = start; i &lt; stop; i += step) {
    yield i;
  }
}

function printColors() {
  var content$ = $('#content');

  for ( var hex of hexRange(900, 999, 10) ) { // contrived example
    var newDiv = $('&lt;div&gt;')
                 .attr('class', 'color')
                 .css({ 'background-color': `#${hex}` })
                 .append(`hex code: #${hex}`);
    content$.append(newDiv);
  }
}

$(printColors);
</pre></code></p>

<p>
You might have noticed this bit <code>function* hexRange</code>, that is a <a target="_blank" title="es6 in depth: generators" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-generators/">ES6 generator</a>. Currently that feature is not supported in all the browsers, to be able to use it we'll need a polyfill. Babel already provides it and we'll use it soon.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to merge all the JS files and use them within a website. The hardest part is writing our Brocfile. This time we'll install 4 plugins:
</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
npm install --save-dev broccoli-babel-transpiler
npm install --save-dev broccoli-funnel
npm install --save-dev broccoli-concat
npm install --save-dev broccoli-merge-trees
</pre></code></p>

<p>Lets put them to use:</p>

<p><code class="js"><pre>
// Babel transpiler
var babel = require('broccoli-babel-transpiler');
// filter trees (subsets of files)
var funnel = require('broccoli-funnel');
// concatenate trees
var concat = require('broccoli-concat');
// merge trees
var mergeTrees = require('broccoli-merge-trees');

// Transpile the source files
var appJs = babel('src');

// Grab the polyfill file provided by the Babel library
var root = 'node_modules/broccoli-babel-transpiler/node_modules/babel-core';
var browserPolyfill = funnel(root, {
  files: ['browser-polyfill.js']
});

// Add the Babel polyfill to the tree of transpiled files
appJs = mergeTrees([browserPolyfill, appJs]);

// Concatenate all the JS files into a single file
appJs = concat(appJs, {
  // we specify a concatenation order
  inputFiles: ['browser-polyfill.js', '**/*.js'],
  outputFile: '/js/my-app.js'
});

// Grab the index file
var index = funnel('src', {files: ['index.html']});

// Grab all our trees and
// export them as a single and final tree
module.exports = mergeTrees([index, appJs]);
</pre></code></p>

<p>Time to build and execute our code.</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
broccoli build dist
</pre></code></p>

<p>
This time you should see the following structure in the <code>dist</code> folder:
</p>

<p><code class="bash"><pre>
$> tree dist/
dist/
├── index.html
└── js
    └── my-app.js
</pre></code></p>

<p>
That is just a static website that you can serve with any server to verify that the code is working, example:
</p>

<p><code class="js"><pre>
cd dist/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
# visit http://localhost:8000/
</pre></code></p>

<p>You should see this:</p>

<h2>There is more!</h2>

<p>With the second example we accomplished a lot and might be all you need to keep you going for a while. For those who want more, you should check this repository: <a target="_blank" title="broccoli-babel-boilerplate" href="https://github.com/jayphelps/broccoli-babel-boilerplate">broccoli-babel-boilerplate</a>. It is also a Broccoli+Babel setup, but taking it up two notches. It handles modules, imports and unit testing.</p>

<p>
You can try out a usage example of that configuration here <a target="_blank" title="es6-modules" href="https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/master/es6-modules">es6-modules</a>. All the magic is in the Brocfile and its very similar to what we have done already.
